        <p>Hi I like house music and the racing game series WipEout</p>
        <br>
        <p>I do random shit in FL Studio and Krita from time to time. Mostly of the house and vectorheart variety, respectively. I usually post these on Bluesky.</p>

        <h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
        <iframe src="https://kootstra-rene.github.io/enge-js/" class="responsive-iframe" title="PlayStation 1"></iframe>
        <p>Attached is an iframe for eNGE, an experimental PS1 emulator written in pure JavaScript. I have tested this with Rage Racer, and it seems to work just fine if you're using the software render version, which is what I linked. It doesn't seem to support controllers, though, so unless you get it working by messing with site permissions, have fun playing PS1 games with a keyboard.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>1. Please please PLEASE make sure you're using Chrome or a Chromium-based browser. Trust me, I have tried it with Firefox and it does Not work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2. Drag and drop your BIOS file into the black screen, and the big text that says "eNGE" should stop blinking red.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3. Drag and drop the BIN file for your game into the black screen, and it should play the PS1 startup, then load your game. For multi-BIN games, just drag and drop the biggest BIN file since that's the one with the game data and the rest are just audio tracks. The audio tracks should still work in this case, though.</p>
        <br>
        <p>4. Profit</p>
