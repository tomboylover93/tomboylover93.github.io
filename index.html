        <p>Hi I like house/techstep/electronica in general and the racing game series WipEout</p>
        <br>
        <p>I do random shit in FL Studio and Krita from time to time. Mostly of the deep house and vectorheart variety, respectively. I usually post these on Bluesky.</p>

        <iframe src="https://kootstra-rene.github.io/enge-js/" class="responsive-iframe" title="PlayStation 1"></iframe>
        <p>Attached is an iframe for eNGE, an experimental PS1 emulator written in pure JavaScript. I have tested this with Rage Racer and WipEout 3 (Japanese & Special Edition), and it seems to work just fine if you're using the software render version, which is what I linked. It does support controllers, but apparently only on Firefox, however the audio doesn't work there.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>1. Drag and drop your BIOS file into the black screen, and the big text that says "eNGE" should stop blinking red.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2. Drag and drop the BIN file for your game into the black screen, and it should play the PS1 startup, then load your game. For multi-BIN games, just drag and drop the biggest BIN file since that's the one with the game data and the rest are just audio tracks. The audio tracks should still work in this case, though.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3. Profit</p>
